*The home of useful Essentials documentation*

Essentials is a collection of gameplay-altering original code
designed for use in an RPG Maker XP game. This wiki contains
documentation for that original code, and is itself 100% original
information. Images on this wiki are used for illustrative purposes and

Essentials has its own sections on the [Pok√©Community
